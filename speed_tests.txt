NOTE: All tests performed on an Intel iMac (2Ghz Core Duo) with 3GB ram, running under MAMP. Zend Optimizer is off. Used Apache Bench with the command: ab -n 50 -c 10 http://ocular.local/. Each test was run 5 times consecutively and the results were averaged. The only view being displayed was the welcome page. Each Batch of tests was run on a different day, but a new baseline was run each time to give a relative score. Average speed reduction was calculated based on the xcache results.
