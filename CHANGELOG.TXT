// OCULAR TEMPLATE LIBRARY
// by Lonnie Ezell (http://igniteyourcode.com/ocular)
//
// version: 2.1
//---------------------------------------------------------------

Version 2.1
Changes:
	- removed handlers to simplify and increase performance
	- stopped using the language file since it's additional overhead and CI doesn't for it's errors.
	
Version 2.0b3
Additions:
	- Thanks to Deep Arora on the CI Forums for getting this setup to allow for use of 
	  the template parser within Ocular.
	- Added 'OCU_ajax_layout' to settings. The render() function checks if it's in an 
	  AJAX call, if so, it overrides the layout with the one in the settings.

Changes: 
	- changed OCU_use_themes to OCU_use_mobile_themes for clarity
Bugs:
	- Fixed messages to check for the right sessions class...


Version 2.0b2
Additions: 
	- now adds $active_controller, $active_view and $active_function to the data array for use in views.

Bugs: 
	- _check_layout now works with custom layout names.
	- render() no longer resets the view name if a custom one has been set.
	- fixed block() to actually use the $this->blocks value.
