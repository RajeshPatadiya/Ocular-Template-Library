Version 2.13
Additions: 
	- Added the themed_view() function.
Changes: 
	- When the message() method is called, it will remove the session data before exiting to ensure you don't see the message on pages you shouldn't.
	- Blocks now allow a $data array to be passed to them, which will be passed to the view in place of the global $data collection.
Bugs: 
	- Removed a stray debug echo.
	- The ajax view should now render correctly.

Version 2.12
Additions: 
	- Breadcrumb function added.
Changes: 
	- The set() method can now accept arrays. (Thanks to dkenzik)
	- The library should now automatically find the correct views when the controller is in a sub-folder (Thanks to alertmybanjos)
Bugs: 
	- Yield function now renders properly (Thanks to hammudi and alertmybanjos for pointing out that it wasn't in the repo)
	- MY_Loader.php is added back into the repo for the fallback function with themes to work. (Thanks dkenzik)

Version 2.1.0
Changes:
Additions: 
	- Added view caching.
Bugs:
	- now correctly returns a 404 error when the 'current_view' doesn't exist.
	- default AJAX view was incorrectly still using $this->ocular. 
	- set_message() wasn't storing messages across sessions. Changed to check for CI_Session instead of session.
	- set_theme() was checking for an old config setting. Updated to OCU_use_mobile_themes.

Version 2.0.4
Changes:
	- removed handlers to simplify and increase performance
	- stopped using the language file since it's additional overhead and CI doesn't for it's errors.
	
Version 2.0b3
Additions:
	- Thanks to Deep Arora on the CI Forums for getting this setup to allow for use of 
	  the template parser within Ocular.
	- Added 'OCU_ajax_layout' to settings. The render() function checks if it's in an 
	  AJAX call, if so, it overrides the layout with the one in the settings.

Changes: 
	- changed OCU_use_themes to OCU_use_mobile_themes for clarity
Bugs:
	- Fixed messages to check for the right sessions class...


Version 2.0b2
Additions: 
	- now adds $active_controller, $active_view and $active_function to the data array for use in views.

Bugs: 
	- _check_layout now works with custom layout names.
	- render() no longer resets the view name if a custom one has been set.
	- fixed block() to actually use the $this->blocks value.
